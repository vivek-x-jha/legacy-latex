                                  If X and Yare aete, the inter.edion 0/ X and Y, denoted by X ("\ Y, is 
                      defined to be the set of all objects which are both  elements of X and ele-
                      ments of Y. In eymbole, 
                                                                     X ("\ Y ....  (z : z E X  and  z E YI. 
                                  The union oJ X and Y, denoted XU Y, is the Bet of all objects which 
                      are elements of at leut one of the Bets X and  Y. That i8. XU Y is the set 
                      of all objects which are either elemente of X or elements of Y (or of both),

                       The word "or"  is ueed here in the manner that is standard  in mathematica. 
                       In ordinary  language  the word "or"  is often exclusive, that is, if A and B 
                       are statements,  then  II A  or B" is underetood  to mean  "A or B  but  not 
                       both",  whereu in mathematice it altDtJlI' meane" A or B, or both A and B". 
                                                                                   ,2.  0 ....... 0 ... 011 .....    I

                             X  -    (s E 8: s ~ 11,  Y - (s E 8: 0 ~ s S 11. 
            (The symbols  ~ and S will be defined later.) Then

                   Certain relationa hold among the symbols  A, V, e. For example, if 
            X and Yare aubeeta of & set 8, then

                            If X  and  Y  are  seta,  the  notation  X -                                                     Y  is  BOmetimes used  for

                            Two seta are said to be diajoinl  if they  have  no element  in common. 
                  That is, X and  Y are disjoint  if X ("\ Y = flJ. A collection of any  number 
                  of. leta is aid to be disjoint  if every  two of the sets are disjoint. 
                      .      The intersection  and  union  of more than  two seta may be defined in 
                   an obvious manner.  For example, if X, Y, Z ar.e seta then 
                                          X ("\ Y ("\ Z -                   Ix : % E X, x E Y,  x E ZI,

                   the  union  of  three  seta.  More  generally  the  intersection  and  union  of 
                   arbitrary  families of seta may be defined, and in an obvious way. The only 
                   problem  is finding an  adequate  notation  for an arbitrary  family  of seta, 
                   and tbia is done .. folloW1l. Let 1 be any set and  for each i E 1 let Xi be

           the proof. 
                 If G and  b are objects,  by  the  ordered ptJir (G, b)  we mean the  two 
           objects G and b in a definite order, G first, b second. Thus  if G,  b, e, d are 
           objects then (G, b) == (e, d) if and only if G = e and b - d. Note the distinc-
           tion between (G, b) and (G, bl i the latter is a set with two elements (unlefl8, 
           of COU1'8e, G happens to equal li, in which case (G, b J - (a I, a set with one 
           element), and  la, hI can equally well be written  (b, aI, spoiling the order. 
           We remark that  instead  of introducing  the  new concept "ordered  pair" 
           into set theory,  we can actually  define the ordered pair (a, b) in terms of 
           the  primitive  notions about  sets  that  we already  have:  we set  (a, b) ... 
           I(al, (G, bll. This  definition  does precisely what  we want:  to  any  two 
           objects a, b (distinct or not) it auigns  an object (a, b), and it does this in 
           such a faeruon that  (a, b) - (e, d) if and only if a ... e and b =- d. 
                 Given two sets X and  Y we define the cartuian  prod4ld (or prodtACl) 
           oj X and Y, denoted  X X Y, to be the set of all ordered pairs the  fint 
           member of which is in X, the second in Y, that is 
                                     X X Y = (x, y)  : x E X, y E YI. 
                 Ordinary rectangular coordinates in the plane give the uaual pictorial 
            representation  of the cartesian product:  the whole plane can be identified 
           with the product of the two coordinate axes. In Figure 3 there is a niore 
           complicated picture in which X, Y are subsets of the two coordinate axes 
           and the cartesian product is a ~baet of the first quadrant.
