                                   1      Notions from Set Theory
                                   1.1     Sets and Elements. Subsets
                                   Set theory supplies the basic language for all that follows, so we fix the most
                                   common conventions. We will not attempt to “define” the word set; informally
                                                                               2
                               a set is simply a collection of objects, called its elements. Typical sets are the
                               students enrolled at a particular university, the straight lines in the plane, or
                               the real numbers. Elements of a set may themselves be sets: an element of
                               the set of straight lines in the plane is the set of points on that line. We use
                               capital letters for sets, lower case letters for their elements, and the symbol ∈
                               for membership. Thus
                                                                   x∈S
                               means that x is a member of the set S, while x ∈/ S abbreviates “x is not an
                               element of S”. A set is completely determined by its elements; explicitly X = Y
                               if and only if every x satisfies x ∈ X ⇔ x ∈ Y. The difference between a set
                               and its elements is crucial: the set {x} consists of a single element, and must
                               not be confused with x itself.
                                  The notation {x ,x ,x } lists the indicated elements, while set-builder no-
                                                   1  2  3
                               tation
                                                   {x ∈ S : x satisfies a stated property}
                               collects all elements of S with the desired property. For example
                                            {x ∈ R : 0 ≤ x ≤ 1},     {n : n is a positive integer}
                               are two subsets of the real numbers R. The symbol ∅ denotes the empty set,
                               the unique set with no elements.
                               Definition 1.1 (Subset). If X and S are sets we write X ⊆ S when every
                               element of X is also an element of S; that is
                                                   X⊆S ⇐⇒ ∀x(x∈X⇒x∈S).
                               If X ⊆ S and X ̸= S we write X ⊊ S and call X a proper subset of S.
                                  The relation X ⊆ S is always true when X = S, and is vacuously true
                               when X = ∅ because there are no elements that violate the implication. A
                               frequent source of confusion is mixing up the symbols ⊆ and ∈; for example
                               {2,3} ⊆ {1,2,3}, whereas 2 ∈ {1,2,3}.
                               1.2    Operations on Sets
                               The standard operations on sets are intersection, union, and complement.
                               Definition 1.2 (Intersection and Union). If X and Y are sets their intersection
                               and union are
                                   X∩Y ={x:x∈X and x∈Y},                 X∪Y ={x:x∈X orx∈Y}.
                               The word “or” is inclusive: x belongs to X ∪ Y when it lies in X, or in Y, or
                               in both sets.
                                                                     3
                               Definition 1.3 (Complement and Difference). If X is a subset of a fixed “am-
                               bient” set S, the complement of X in S is
                                                          S\X={x∈S:x∈/X},
                               and we often abbreviate this to Xc once S is understood. For any two sets we
                               also write
                                                     X−Y =X∩Yc={x∈X:x∈/Y}
                               and call this the set difference or relative complement of Y in X.
                                   Therelations amongthese operations mirror the familiar algebraic identities.
                               For instance, if X,Y ⊆ S then
                                                 c     c           c       c     c           c
                                               X ∩Y =(X∪Y) ,             X ∪Y =(X∩Y) ,
                               which are the De Morgan laws.
                                   Sets X and Y are disjoint if X ∩Y = ∅; a family of sets is disjoint if every
                               two distinct members are disjoint. Intersections and unions extend to any finite
                               number of sets by iterating the preceding definitions, and to arbitrary families
                               via index sets. If I is an indexing set and {X }    is a family of subsets of S,
                               then                                           i i∈I

                               Definition 1.4 (Ordered Pair and Cartesian Product). The ordered pair (a,b)
                               records a as the first component and b as the second; (a,b) = (c,d) if and only
                               if a = c and b = d. One possible set-theoretic realization is due to Kuratowski:
                                                            (a,b) = {{a},{a,b}}.
                               Given sets X and Y the Cartesian product
                                                       X×Y ={(x,y):x∈X,y∈Y}
                               is the set of all ordered pairs whose first coordinate comes from X and second
                               from Y.
                               1.3    Functions
                               Definition 1.5 (Function). If X and Y are sets, a function f from X to Y is
                               a rule that assigns to each x ∈ X a definite element f(x) ∈ Y . We encode this
                               by writing f : X → Y, and call X the domain and Y the codomain of f. Two
                               functions f,g : X → Y are equal when f(x) = g(x) for every x ∈ X.
                                                                      4
                                            Functions may be described by listing the pairs (x,f(x)), by a formula (for
                                        example f(x) = x2+3x−2 on R), or geometrically via their graphs. Any subset
                                        of the plane meeting each vertical line in at most one point is the graph of a
                                        real-valued function on a subset of R. The defining rule need not be easy to
                                        compute: the function that sends each real number to the digit in its billionth
                                        decimal place is a legitimate example.
                                            The graph of f : X → Y is the subset {(x,f(x)) : x ∈ X} of X × Y.
                                        Conversely, any subset of X × Y that contains exactly one ordered pair with
                                        first coordinate x for each x ∈ X determines a function X → Y. In this sense
                                        the data of the domain, codomain, and graph together determine the function.
                                            If f : X → Y and X′ ⊆ X, the restriction f|X′ : X′ → Y is defined by
                                        f| ′(x) = f(x). If Y ⊆ Y′ we may view f as a function into Y ′ without changing
                                          X
                                        the rule. Given f : X → Y and g : Y → Z, the composition g ◦ f : X → Z is
                                        given by (g ◦ f)(x) = g(f(x)). The identity map on X is denoted iX : X → X,
                                        i  (x) = x.
                                         X
                                        Definition 1.6 (Injective, Surjective, Bijective). A function f : X → Y is
                                        injective (or one-to-one) if f(x ) = f(x ) implies x                   = x . It is surjective
                                                                                 1           2              1       2
                                        (onto) if every y ∈ Y equals f(x) for some x ∈ X. A bijection is both injective
                                        and surjective, and hence establishes a one-to-one correspondence between X
                                        and Y.
                                            If f : X → Y is bijective there exists an inverse function f−1 : Y → X
                                        satisfying f−1(f(x)) = x and f(f−1(y)) = y. For an arbitrary function f and
                                        subsets X′ ⊆ X, Y′ ⊆ Y,
                                                   f(X′) = {f(x) : x ∈ X′},              f−1(Y′) = {x ∈ X : f(x) ∈ Y′}
                                        are called the image of X′ and the inverse image (or preimage) of Y′, respec-
                                        tively. When f is bijective these two uses of f−1 are compatible: f−1({y}) is
                                        the singleton containing f−1(y).
                                        1.4      Finite and Infinite Sets
                                        Let N = {1,2,3,...} denote the positive integers.
                                        Definition 1.7 (Finite Set). A set X is finite if either X = ∅ or there exists
                                        n ∈ N together with a bijection between X and {1,2,...,n}. In that case we
                                        write |X| = n and call n the number of elements of X.
                                            Any subset of a finite set is finite; if the subset is proper, then it contains
                                        fewer elements than the ambient set. A set is infinite when it is not finite:
                                        intuitively we can keep choosing distinct elements without ever exhausting the
                                        set. The following characterization is often useful.
                                        Theorem 1.1. A set X is infinite if and only if it can be put into a one-to-one
                                        correspondence with a proper subset of itself.
                                                                                         5
                                   Proof. If X is finite, any proper subset has fewer elements, so no bijection can
                                   exist. Conversely, suppose X is infinite. Choose distinct elements x ,x ,x ,...

                                                                1   2   3                              2   3
                                   f(x ) = x       for k ≥ 1 and f(y) = y for y ∈ Y. This f is a bijection from X

                                   Definition 2.1 (Group). A group is an ordered pair (G,·) consisting of a

                                   Definition 2.2 (Abelian Group). A group (G,·) is Abelian if x·y = y ·x for
                                   every x,y ∈ G.
                                   Definition 2.3 (Field). A field is a set F equipped with two operations + and ·
                                   such that (F,+) is an Abelian group with identity 0 , the nonzero elements form

                                   Definition 2.4 (Real Numbers). The set of real numbers R is the unique (up to
                                   isomorphism) complete ordered field. For our purposes it sufÏces to remember
                                   that (R,+,·) is a field whose multiplicative identity is denoted 1 and additive
                                   identity is denoted 0.
                                      Besides R, the rational numbers Q and the complex numbers C provide
                                   common examples of fields. Finite fields also exist—the smallest is {0,1} with
                                   addition and multiplication taken modulo 2.
                                      Associativity allows parentheses to be suppressed and the commutativity
                                   of Abelian groups lets us permute terms freely. The next statements collect

                                 Lemma 2.1 (Cancellation). If (G,·) is a group and x,y,z ∈ G, then the equa-
                                 tion w · y = z has the unique solution w = z · y−1. In particular, x · y = x · z
                                 forces y = z and y · x = z · x forces y = z.
                                 Proof. Multiplying w·y = z on the right by y−1 yields w = z·y−1. Conversely,
                                 plugging w = z ·y−1 back into the equation shows it is indeed a solution. If w′
                                 is another solution, then w′ · y = z = w · y. Right-multiplying by y−1 produces
                                 w′ = w, proving uniqueness.

                                 For (2), if x ̸= 0 then multiplying xy = 0 by x        yields y = 0 .

                                     Theadditive inverse is characterized by x+(−x) = 0 , so uniqueness follows
                                                                                             F
                                 from Lemma 2.1 applied to (F,+). Because 1 + (−1 ) = 0 , we may write

                                 −x=(−1 )x=x(−1 ), proving (3). Then

                                           −(x+y)=(−1 )(x+y)=(−1 )x+(−1 )y=(−x)+(−y),

                                 which establishes (4).
                                     To prove (5), observe that (−1 )(−1 ) + (−1 )(1 ) = (−1 )(−1 + 1 ) =

                                 ((−1 )(−1 ))xy = xy. Finally, if x,y ̸= 0 , then
                                      F     F                                F

                                                                                                F
                                 so y−1x−1 is the inverse of xy, giving (6).
                                     The propositions above are the algebraic workhorses for manipulating ex-
                                 pressions. In later chapters we will freely use them to simplify equations before
                                 extracting analytic information.
                                                                           7
                             2.2    Order
                             Afield becomes truly useful for analysis only after it is endowed with an order
                             relation that allows us to compare magnitudes.
                             Definition 2.5 (Ordered field). An ordered field is a field (F,+,·) equipped
                             with a relation < satisfying the following axioms for all x,y,z:
                                1. Exactly one of the relations x < y, x = y, or x > y holds (trichotomy).
                                2. If x < y, then x + z < y + z (compatibility with addition).
                                3. If x < y and 0 < z, then xz < yz (compatibility with multiplication).
                                 Write x ≤ y when x < y or x = y. The set of positive elements is F   =
                                                                                                   >0
                             {x ∈ F : x > 0}, and x > 0 if and only if −x < 0.
                             Lemma 2.2. In an ordered field the following are immediate consequences of
                             the axioms:
                                1. If x > 0 and y > 0, then x+y > 0 and xy > 0.
                                2. If x < y and z < w, then x+z < y +w.
                                3. If 0 < z and x < y, then xz < yz, while multiplying by a negative number
                                   reverses the inequality.
                             Proof. Each item is an application of the compatibility axioms together with
                             Proposition 2.1. For instance, if x,y > 0 then x + y > x + 0 = x and also
                             x+y>y,showingx+y>0. Likewise, if x < y and 0 < z, subtracting xz from
                             both sides of xz + xz < yz +xz proves xz < yz.
                                 Intervals, rays, and absolute values are defined in the usual way. For exam-
                             ple, (a,b) = {x ∈ R : a < x < b} is an open interval, while |x| = max{x,−x}
                             is the nonnegative distance from 0. These notions allow us to talk about neigh-
                             borhoods and ultimately limits.
                             2.3    The Least Upper Bound Property
                             Theorderrelation lets us compare numbers, but a deeper property distinguishes
                             the real numbers from the rationals.
                             Definition 2.6 (Bounds). Let S ⊆ R. An upper bound of S is a number u
                             with x ≤ u for all x ∈ S. A least upper bound (or supremum) is an upper
                             bound s such that every other upper bound satisfies s ≤ u. Lower bounds and
                             the greatest lower bound (infimum) are defined analogously.
                             Theorem 2.1 (Least Upper Bound Axiom). Every nonempty subset of R that
                             is bounded above has a supremum in R. Likewise every nonempty set that is
                             bounded below has an infimum.
                                                                  8
                                                                                         2
                                   This completeness axiom fails for Q (the set {x ∈ Q : x < 2} has no rational
                               supremum) and is the key tool for constructing limits without appealing to
                               decimals. A commonly used consequence is the following elementary squeeze
                               principle for monotone sequences.
                               Proposition 2.2. If {a } is an increasing sequence of real numbers that is
                                                        n
                               bounded above, then a converges to sup{a : n ∈ N}.
                                                     n                    n
                               Proof. Let s denote the supremum. Given ε > 0, s−ε is not an upper bound,
                               so there exists N with a   >s−ε. For n≥N the sequence is increasing, hence
                                                       N
                               s−ε<a ≤s. This proves lim            a =s.
                                         n                     n→∞ n
                               2.4    The Existence of Square Roots
                               One immediate application of completeness is the construction of square roots.
                                                                                                       2
                               Theorem 2.2. For every a > 0 there exists a unique b > 0 such that b = a.
                                                                                 2
                               Proof. Consider the set S = {x ∈ R : x ≥ 0 and x ≤ a}. It is nonempty (since
                               0 ∈ S) and bounded above (for example by a+1). Let b = supS. We first show
                                2                  2                        2
                               b ≤a. Otherwise b > a and putting ε = b −a > 0 we may take η = ε/(2b);
                                                                           2    2          2    2        2
                               note that b > 0 because a > 0. Then (b−η) = b −2bη+η = b −ε+η > a,
                               so every x ∈ S satisfies x < b−η. That means b−η is an upper bound smaller
                                                                                2
                               than b, contradicting the definition of b. Hence b ≤ a.
                                   If b2 < a, set ε = a − b2 > 0 and choose η = min{1,ε/(2b+1)}. Then
                                                  2    2           2    2                2
                                           (b +η) =b +2bη+η ≤b +η(2b+1)≤b +ε=a,
                               so b + η ∈ S. This contradicts b being an upper bound. Therefore b2 = a.
                                                                                                   2
                                   Uniqueness follows from the order axioms: if c > 0 also satisfies c = a, then
                               (b −c)(b+c) = 0. Proposition 2.1 implies either b = c or b = −c. The latter is
                               impossible because b,c > 0, so b = c.
                                   The existence of square roots supplies the positive branch of the absolute
                               value and, together with the field axioms, completes the algebraic description
                               of R.
                               3     Metric Spaces
                               3.1    Definition and Examples
                               Ametric space abstracts the idea of distance.
                               Definition 3.1 (Metric Space). A metric space is a pair (M,d) where M is a
                               set and d: M ×M → R satisfies for all x,y,z ∈ M:
                                  1. Nonnegativity and identity: d(x,y) ≥ 0 with d(x,y) = 0 if and only if
                                     x=y.
                                                                      9
                                   2. Symmetry: d(x,y) = d(y,x).
                                   3. Triangle inequality: d(x,z) ≤ d(x,y)+d(y,z).
                                The map d is called a metric or distance function.
                                    The nonnegativity condition is redundant but useful to record explicitly.
                                Lemma 3.1. For any metric d we always have d(x,y) ≥ 0.
                                Proof. Symmetry gives d(x,y) = d(y,x), so d(x,y) = (d(x,y) + d(y,x))/2 ≥
                                (d(x,x))/2 = 0.
                                    The triangle inequality can be iterated, a fact used repeatedly when esti-

                                Proof. The case n = 3 is the usual triangle inequality. If the statement holds
                                for n, apply the triangle inequality to d(x ,x    ) ≤ d(x ,x )+d(x ,x        ) and
                                                                           1   n+1        1  n        n  n+1

                                Corollary 3.1.1 (Reverse Triangle Inequality). For all x,y,z ∈ M,

                                Proof. Applyingthetriangleinequalitytod(z,x) ≤ d(z,y)+d(y,x)andd(z,y) ≤
                                d(z,x)+d(x,y) yields −d(x,y) ≤ d(x,z)−d(z,y) ≤ d(x,y).

                                Theorem 3.2 (Cauchy–Schwarz). For all x,y ∈ R , |x·y| ≤ ∥x∥∥y∥.
                                Proof. Consider p(t) = ∥ty+x∥2. This is a quadratic polynomial with nonneg-
                                ative values, so its discriminant is nonpositive. Expanding p(t) gives the desired
                                inequality.
                                Corollary 3.2.1. The Euclidean norm is subadditive: ∥x+y∥ ≤ ∥x∥+∥y∥.

                                                                                              n
                             Proposition 3.1 (Euclidean Metric). If d(x,y) = ∥x − y∥, then (R ,d) is a
                             metric space.
                             Proof. Symmetry and the identity of indiscernibles follow from the norm. Sub-
                             additivity of the norm (Corollary 3.2.1) gives the triangle inequality.
                             Corollary 3.2.2. On R the metric d(x,y) = |x − y| coincides with Proposi-
                             tion 3.1 for n = 1.
                                Two additional models appear frequently.
                             Definition 3.3 (Discrete Metric). For any nonempty set M, the function
                             d(x,y) = 0 if x = y and 1 otherwise defines a metric. Every subset is both
                             open and closed in this topology.
                                                                                         P
                                                       1               n                   n
                             Definition 3.4 (Taxicab (ℓ ) Metric). On R define d (x,y) =      |x −y |.
                                                                                1          i=1  i   i
                             The triangle inequality comes from the subadditivity of absolute value in each
                             coordinate. This metric induces the same topology as the Euclidean metric, but
                             distances measure “city blocks” instead of straight lines.
                             3.2   Open and Closed Sets
                             Let Br(p) = {x ∈ M : d(x,p) < r} and Br(p) = {x ∈ M : d(x,p) ≤ r} denote
                             open and closed balls.
                             Definition 3.5 (Open and Closed Set). A subset U ⊆ M is open if every x ∈ U
                             has a ball B (x) ⊆ U. A subset is closed if its complement is open. The empty
                                        r
                             set and M itself are both open and closed.
                             Proposition 3.2. Open balls are open sets and closed balls are closed sets.
                             Proof. Fix x ∈ B (p) and set ρ = r − d(x,p) > 0. If y ∈ B (x), then d(y,p) ≤
                                             r                                      ρ
                             d(y,x) + d(x,p) < ρ + d(x,p) = r, so y ∈ Br(p). The closed case follows by
                             applying the argument to complements.
                             Theorem 3.3. For any metric space M:
                               1. The union of any family of open sets is open.
                               2. The intersection of finitely many open sets is open.
                               3. Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed, and finite unions of closed
                                  sets are closed.
                             Proof. The first two statements follow by chasing points through the definitions
                             of open sets. Taking complements converts them into the assertions about closed
                             sets.
                                In R open balls are precisely open intervals (a,b) and closed balls are closed
                             intervals [a,b]. More generally, rectangular boxes {x : a < x < b } are open in
                                                                                i    i   i
                             Rn, while their closures are closed.
                                                                11
                               Definition 3.6 (Bounded Set). A subset S ⊆ M is bounded if there exist
                               p ∈ M and r > 0 with S ⊆ Br(p).
                               Proposition 3.3. Finite unions of bounded sets are bounded. In Rn, every
                               closed rectangle Qn [a ,b ] is bounded.
                                                 i=1 i i
                               Proof. If U  ⊆ B (p ) for k = 1,...,n, then S U ⊆ S B (p ), which
                                          k      rk  k                            k  k      k  rk  k
                               is contained in a slightly larger closed ball centered at one of the pk.  The
                               rectangular case follows from the Euclidean metric: each coordinate difference
                               is bounded by |b −a |, so ∥x−a∥ ≤ ∥b−a∥ for any x in the rectangle.
                                               i    i
                                  Closed and bounded subsets of R contain their extremal points.
                               Theorem 3.4. If S ⊂ R is nonempty, closed, and bounded above, then S has
                               a greatest element. A dual statement holds for bounded-below sets.
                               Proof. Let c = supS. Since S is closed, Sc is open, so if c ∈/ S there exists
                               r > 0 with (c − r,c + r) ⊆ Sc. But then c − r is an upper bound smaller than
                               c, contradicting the definition of supremum. Hence c ∈ S.
                               3.3    Convergent Sequences
                               Definition 3.7 (Sequence and Limit). A sequence in M is a function p: N →
                               M, usually written {pn}. It converges to p ∈ M, written pn → p, if for every
                               ε > 0 there exists N with d(pn,p) < ε whenever n ≥ N.
                                  If a sequence converges, its limit is unique. Every convergent sequence is
                               bounded. Conversely, in Rn a bounded monotone sequence converges by the
                               least upper bound property established in Chapter 2.
                               3.4    Completeness
                               Definition 3.8 (Cauchy Sequence and Completeness). A sequence {p } is
                                                                                                        n
                               Cauchy if for every ε > 0 there exists N such that d(p ,p ) < ε for all
                                                                                          n  m
                               m,n≥N. A metric space is complete if every Cauchy sequence converges.
                                                    n
                               Proposition 3.4. R with the Euclidean metric is complete.
                               Proof. A Cauchy sequence in Rn is Cauchy in each coordinate, so every coordi-
                               nate converges by completeness of R. The vector of coordinate limits provides
                                            n
                               the limit in R .
                               3.5    Compactness
                               Definition 3.9 (Compact Set). A subset K ⊆ M is compact if every open
                               cover of K admits a finite subcover. Equivalently, every sequence in K has a
                               convergent subsequence with limit in K (sequential compactness).
                                                                            n
                               Theorem 3.5 (Heine–Borel). A subset of R is compact if and only if it is
                               closed and bounded.
                                                                     12
                           Compact sets enjoy familiar finiteness properties: they are bounded, closed,
                        and continuous images of compact sets are compact. These facts play a central
                        role when we pass to continuous functions in the next chapter.
                        3.6  Connectedness
                        Definition 3.10 (Connected Set). A metric space M is connected if it cannot
                        be written as the union of two disjoint nonempty open sets. A subset E ⊆ M is
                        connected if it is connected with the subspace metric.
                           Intervals in R are precisely the connected subsets. More generally, products
                        of connected sets remain connected, and continuous images of connected sets
                        are connected. These structural facts allow us to promote local information
                        from Chapter 4 to global statements such as the Intermediate Value Theorem.
